  "comment": "String",
  "status": "PENDING | ACCEPTED | REJECTED",

üîπ API Endpoints

üèóÔ∏è Load Management

Method	            Endpoint	          Description

POST	              /load	              Create a new load
GET	                /load	              Fetch loads with filters
GET	                /load/{loadId}	    Get details of a specific load
PUT	                /load/{loadId}	    Update a load
DELETE	            /load/{loadId}	    Delete a load

üöö Booking Management

Method	            Endpoint	              Description
POST	              /booking	              Create a new booking
GET	                /booking	              Fetch bookings (filter support)
GET	                /booking/{bookingId}	  Get details of a specific booking
PUT	                /booking/{bookingId}	  Update a booking
DELETE	            /booking/{bookingId}	  Delete a booking

üß† Assumptions
1) The id field is intentionally hidden from Swagger for security, but it is included in API responses can be checked by POSTMAN.
2)Filtering is strictly limited to shipperId, productType, and truckType to avoid misuse.
3) Status can be one of: POSTED, BOOKED, CANCELLED. Default is POSTED.
4) Timestamps follow ISO 8601 format (UTC).
5) All APIs return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

üß™ Testing
You can test endpoints directly using Swagger or tools like Postman(it will help to access load id which cannot be accessed directly from Swagger).
